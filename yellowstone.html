        <p>Yellowstone National Park has rich human and ecological stories that continue to unfold. People have spent time in the Yellowstone region for more than 11,000 years. Many tribes and bands used the park as their home, hunting grounds, and transportation routes prior to and after European American arrival. Yellowstone was established as the world's first national park in 1872.There are lots of great outdoor things to do in Yellowstone National Park. There are lots of attractions around the park to see like the Grand Prismatic and Old Faithful. If you are wanting to escape the crowds, there are lots of great physical activities like hiking, looking for wildlife, biking, fly fishing, and horseback riding.</p>
        <p>A variety of dining facilities are available throughout the park: restaurants, cafeterias (canteens), snack shops, ice cream counters, coffee counters, and bars.</p>

            <h4> <b>Running Bear</b> </h4>
            <p>A family-run restaurant since it opened in 1965, Running Bear is simple and charming. The space is covered in stuffed, painted, and framed bears â€” an homage to the black bear who accidentally locked itself in the back room one evening in the 1960s.The breakfast menu has something for everyone. They offer house-baked pastry, cinnamon roll dotted with pecans and served with coffee made using local Hell Roaring espresso beans. The seafood omelet is packed with shrimp and shredded crab and held together by melted Swiss.
